### Initial thoughts on app structure

- Seeding a database with API info (still figuring out how to).
- Show in an intuitive way the info scouted.
- Easy to use inviting design.
- If time permits a space news row.
- Auth if brain doesn't fries.
- Deployment to heroku is obscure.

### Phases of Completion

- Info scouting.
- Peeling the onion of the api's.
- File Structure development.

- Styling.
